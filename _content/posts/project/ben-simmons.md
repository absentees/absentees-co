## The problem

In 2017-2018, Ben Simmons was on track to become the NBA Rookie of the Year and one of the biggest names in basketball around the world. He required a brand and digital presence that told his story and represented what he did on the court, his love for video games and his passion for giving back to the community.

## A new digital-first brand

The creative team at Present Company developed a new brand strategy and identity for Ben while it was my task to bring it to life for the web. The brand was built to scale, as was Ben's website, and we created a simple set of styles, components and page layouts to host content for what we knew we needed now and what was to come.

## Design to the context

Early in the design process, we put up a placeholder page to allow for visitors to be the first to hear when the full site launched. We had no trouble capturing traffic as Ben's 1.2 million Instagram follows were fairly quick to click into the new link appearing in his profile.

This was crucial to the small-screen first approach taken to the site. Our audience wasn't sitting down at their big-screen desktop or even laptop to visit the site, they were 90% of the time on their phones, via Instagram and scrolling, tapping and reading fast.
