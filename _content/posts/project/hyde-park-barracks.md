The Hyde Park Barracks team came to Pollen initially to help them create the digital strategy for their new inclusive and accessible museum. As part of the strategy I took on the design and delivery of the new website, built in a modular framework for flexibility and with a strong focus on inclusive design from copy and layout through to additional wrappers on video for better controls.
