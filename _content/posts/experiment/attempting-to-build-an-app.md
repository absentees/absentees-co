Found Around is an app to guide people to learn about their local flora and fauna (animals and plants), by giving them Collections based on geographic locations. For each animal or plant, a series of Tips are given to help you identify, then a photo is saved into the app to mark it as found.

It's built using the Expo SDK, on my Windows PC via WSL2 (a tricky configuration) and lots of help from Copilot which for a once-every-now-and-again dev like me is a lifesaver. 

I'm hoping to launch for free for just Android and release additional Collections in the future.
