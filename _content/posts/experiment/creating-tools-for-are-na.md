> Are.na is a platform for connecting ideas and building knowledge.

I'm a huge fan of the are.na platform, community and approach to web in general. It's built by a small, considered team and often involves users in designing and developing new features.

I use are.na as a bit of a bookmarking, collection tool. Constantly adding URLs and screenshots to a growing list of categories.

[are.na cli tools â†—](https://github.com/absentees/arena-cli-tools) is something i built to cater to some of my workflows.

Uses:
* xo
* meow
* my own fork of arena-js
* cli-meow-help

I'm continuing to build on it and add new functions as i need them.
