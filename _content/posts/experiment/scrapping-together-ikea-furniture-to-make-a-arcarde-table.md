After the release of the mini NES and SNES i looked into the RetroPie OS for Raspberry Pi. A visit to ebay and a few more to Bunnings later i built a two-player top down Arcade Table.

The bits:

* IKEA second hand tabletop
* Bunnings this and that
* Recycled LCD monitor
* Raspberry Pi 3
* 3D printed screen mounts and Pi case
* [RetroPie OS](https://retropie.org.uk/)
