I use are.na daily for bookmarking and discovery of things that i wouldn't find anywhere else. Navigating to my individual channels to grab a reference currently involves navigating to are.na to search or browse the index of my profile. I wanted a direct route.

Typing `arena <channel name>` into the firefox omnibox will list up to six results. Currently it is only doing a public search. 

Future enhancement could for a lot of interaction with the API, not necessarily just for search, similar to what you might achieve with a raycast or alfred plugin.
