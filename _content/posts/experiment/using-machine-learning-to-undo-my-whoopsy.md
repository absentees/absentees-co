Wouldn't it be handy if your computer could sense when you made a mistake?

*Whoopsy Extension* uses a machine learning model trained with [Teachable Machine ↗](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to listen for when you make "whoops" or an "oops" and hits Undo for you.

Used [Tensorflow's Chrome Extension example ↗](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/chrome-extension) and [Netlify Dark Mode Extension ↗](https://github.com/charliegerard/dark-mode-clap-extension)
