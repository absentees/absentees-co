title: Tabling colour tokens in Figma

I had a fairly specific manual task that involved documenting some design tokens that i created into a table for a design system. It was tedious and even though there were some plugins that would get me half way there, i still had to do a lot of manual work. 

Token Table Generator takes a figma colour style in the format of `<Light/Dark>/<Colour Role>/<Colour State>/<Modifier>` and puts it into a table with labels. The token structure uses the Shopify Polaris, with a couple of modifications.

Code for the plugin here if you have a similar use case.
