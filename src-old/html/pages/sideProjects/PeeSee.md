  <p>At our office we had one downstairs male toilet. I noticed that staff would often walk to the toilet only to be disappointed that it was occupied.</p>
  <p>To fix this i grabbed our dusty Rasbperry Pi, a lot of blutack and a reed switch to update a number stored in Firebase indicating the occupancy of the toilet. Staff could then visit a website or use the /peesee command within slack to check whether they were good to go.</p>
  <p>The bits:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Firebase</li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
  <li>Resin.io</li>
  <li>Express</li>
  </ul>
