title: Good Internet Online
published: false
description: |-
  <p>I'm constantly looking at multiple sites for references, I was collecting them using an old Mac App called Ember. It's great at what it did but was no longer under development.</p>
  <p>Good Internet Online started as a place to upload the 1500 screenshots i had taken of websites over the years, but i decided to keep it a bit more niche.</p>
  <p>A cron job scrapes Designer News Site Design category everyday, if a new one is found it takes screenshots using the headless browser PhantomJS, grabs a bit of metadata and uploads to DatoCMS. This triggers Netlify to build and deploy the site.</p>
  <p>The bits:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Netlify CI</li>
  <li>Heroku Daily Schedular with a Node script</li>
  <li>Metalsmith</li>
  <li>Pageres (uses PhantomJS)</li>
  <li>DatoCMS</li>
  </ul>
