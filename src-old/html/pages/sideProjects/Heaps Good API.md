  <p>Over the years at Present Company i've written a bunch of /slash commands to do various useless things. They've brought plenty of laughs and it's always fun seeing other staff use them in different ways.</p>
  <p>/business - Given a keyword, returns a random business related stock photo from istock. <br />/caspart - Returns a random caspart (internal meme) from an S3 bucket containing all the artworks. Good night sweet prince. <br />/it - Given a keyword, returns a beer drinking related image, along with a caption. That's IT. <br />/peesee - Would return the toilet status of my side project PeeSee. <br />/suggest - A staff member asked for an anonymous way for other staff to suggest ways to improve stuff around the office. Anything after the slash command is inserted into a Airtable table anonymously. <br />/whereisarturo - Return @kripy's last known Untappd check-in.</p>
  <p>The bits:</p>
